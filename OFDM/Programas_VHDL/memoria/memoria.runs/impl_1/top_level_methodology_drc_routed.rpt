2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock reloj/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock reloj/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin reloj/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 6.818 ns between reloj/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and mem/cont_fin_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -4.301 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#2 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 6.818 ns between reloj/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and mem/cont_fin_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -4.307 ns.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#3 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 6.818 ns between reloj/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and mem/cont_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -4.257 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
